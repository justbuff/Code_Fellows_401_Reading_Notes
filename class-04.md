# Systems Hardening with CIS Standards

CIS Benchmarks, published by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), are documented industry best practices for securely configuring IT systems, software, and networks.

CIS Benchmarks are developed through a unique consensus-based process involving communities of cybersecurity professionals and subject matter experts around the world, each of which continuously identifies, refines, and validates security best practices within their areas of focus.

## CIS Benchmarks

- Level 1 benchmark profiles cover base-level configurations that are easier to implement and have minimal impact on business functionality. 

- Level 2 benchmark profiles are intended for high-security environments and require more coordination and planning to implement with minimal business disruption.

There are seven core categories of CIS Benchmarks:

1. Operating systems benchmarks cover security configurations of core operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Apple OSX.

2. Server software benchmarks cover security configurations of widely used server software, including Microsoft Windows Server, SQL Server, VMware, Docker, and Kubernetes. 

3. Cloud provider benchmarks address security configurations for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google, IBM, and other popular public clouds.

4. Mobile device benchmarks address mobile operating systems, including iOS and Android, and focus on areas such as developer options and settings, OS privacy configurations, browser settings, and app permissions.

5. Network device benchmarks offer general and vendor-specific security configuration guidelines for network devices and applicable hardware from Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, Juniper, and others.

6. Desktop software benchmarks cover security configurations for some of the most commonly used desktop software applications, including Microsoft Office and Exchange Server, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari Browser.

7. Multi-function print device benchmarks outline security best practices for configuring multi-function printers in office settings and cover such topics as firmware updating, TCP/IP configurations, wireless access configuration, user management, and file sharing.

CIS benchmark benefits include:

- The collected expertise of a global community of IT and cybersecurity professionals.

- Regularly updated, step-by-step guidance for securing every area of the IT infrastructure.

- Compliance management consistency.

- A flexibility template for securely adopting new cloud services and for executing digital transformation strategies.

- Easy-to-deploy configurations for improved operational efficiency and sustainability.

## Hardened Images

CIS also offers pre-configured Hardened Images that enable enterprises to perform computing operations cost-effectively without needing to invest in additional hardware or software. Hardened images are much more secure than standard virtual images, and they significantly limit the security vulnerabilities that can lead to a cyberattack.
