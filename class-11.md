# Setting Up Splunk SIEM

## Is Cybersecurity Automation the Future?

Cybersecurity products designed to automate specific processes are widespread. For example, vulnerability management products can be configured to automatically detect and scan devices on an enterprise network. They can then conduct an assessment based upon a set of security controls authorized by the organization. Once the assessment is complete, identified defects can be remediated.

Many organizations inspect systems and data manually for evidence of unexpected behavior and indicators of compromise or defect. Automation can address lean or ill-proportioned cybersecurity teams, as it is simply unrealistic to expect human teams to catch potential cybersecurity events reliably.

Benefits of automation:

- Engineering and Architecture: Automation will allow the cybersecurity team to focus on designing and implementing cybersecurity strategies, including initiatives such as zero trust and cyber hygiene within the enterprise.

- Remediation Activities: The identified deficiencies from your automation efforts will assist your technical and mission teams by providing more repeatable and actionable insight into the enterprise environment leading to fewer vulnerabilities.

- Automation Development and Engineering: Automation will become an important part of the cybersecurity program requiring its own resources related to ongoing and iterative automation design and implementation.

Three basic approaches to successfully implement automation concepts:

1. Embed development capabilities in your cybersecurity team. In this way, developers report directly to cyber leadership.

2. Partner cybersecurity with organizational development teams. This allows cybersecurity to leverage the capabilities of organizational development experts.

3. Adopt a hybrid approach. Utilize an internal team for tactical development work and organizational development capabilities for complex integration tasks.

## Automated Incident Response Explained

With the right automated incident response tools, IT security teams can stay in control of their incident response (IR) activities and respond to threats and intrusions swiftly and effectively and it can help limit the potential damage an incident can cause to an organization and its customers.

Automated response benefits:

- automatically update the firewall to block malicious IPs as they are detected.

- can shorten the to-do list.

- having a solution with log management capabilities would allow a search for relevant alarms and events instead of combing through them manually.

- can move immediately from detection to response by blocking the domain automatically when the intrusion detection system detects the threat.

- can help you before an incident even occurs. With automated vulnerability scans scheduled to run at regular intervals, you can stay aware of at-risk systems across your infrastructure as new vulnerabilities emerge, allowing you to either patch them or limit their exposure to the rest of your network.

- some solutions include tools to help you keep track of your teamâ€™s IR efforts. 

- you can tailor automated responses to protect your most critical data.
