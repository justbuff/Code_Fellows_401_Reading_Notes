# Strategic Policy Development

SOC 2 compliance is a framework that sends a strong signal that an organization prioritizes key attributes: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. SOC 2 applies to any service provider that stores customer data in the cloud, such as SaaS businesses.

SOC audits are organized around five "Trust Principles":
 
- Security: The foundational security principle, common to all audits.

- Confidentiality: Protection from unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.

- Availability: Protection that systems or data will be available as agreed or required.

- Integrity: Protection that systems or data are not changed in an unauthorized manner.

- Privacy: The use, collection, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information is protected.

To achieve SOC 2 compliance, most companies spend anywhere from six months to a year on focused preparation. This includes identifying which systems are in scope for the audit, developing policies and procedures, and implementing new security controls to reduce risks.

SOC 2 Type I
An audit conducted against the Trust Services Criteria standard at a single point in time.

SOC 2 Type II
An audit conducted against the Trust Service Criteria standard over a period of time. 

SOC 2 compliance improves security, bolsters company culture, provides documentation, and helps with risk management.

The SOC 2 Pyramid:

Foundation (security policies): What you do

Execution (security procedures): How you do it

Proof (supporting documentation): Proof you did it

The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, referred to as Common Criteria, is an internationally recognized standard for computer security certification. 

The nine Common Criteria are:

CC1 - Control environment

CC2 - Communications and information

CC3 - Risk assessment

CC4 - Monitoring activities

CC5 - Control activities

CC6 - Logical and physical address

CC7 - System operations

CC8 - Change management

CC9 - Risk mitigation
