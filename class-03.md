# Cyber Risk Analysis

Risk management involves comprehensive understanding, analysis and mitigation of risk to help organizations achieve their information security objective. The two primary objectives of information security within the organization from a risk management perspective include:

- Have controls in place to support the mission of the organization.

- All the decisions should be based on the risk tolerance of the organization.

A security model has different layers, but it also has different types of goals to accomplish in different time frames. This technique and approach to strategy is called the planning horizon:

- Operational goals: Daily goals, or operational goals, focus on productivity and task-oriented activities to ensure the companyâ€™s functionality in a smooth and predictable manner.

- Tactical goals: Corresponding mid-term goals, or tactical goals, could involve moving computers into domains, installing firewalls and segregating the network by creating a demilitarized zone.

- Strategic goals: A long-term goal, or strategic goal, may involve moving all the branches from dedicated communication lines to frame relay, implementing IPSec virtual private networks (VPNs) for all remote users instead of dial-up entry, and integrating wireless technology with the comprehensive security solutions and controls existing within the environment.

## CIA Triad

Confidentiality, integrity and availability (the CIA triad) is a typical security framework intended to guide policies for information security within an organization.

Confidentiality: Prevent unauthorized disclosure

Integrity: Detect modification of information

Availability: Provide timely and reliable access to resources

## Risk management

The following definitions are crucial for risk management:

Asset: Anything of value to the company

Vulnerability: A weakness, the absence of a safeguard

Threat: Things that could pose a risk to all or part of an asset

Threat agent: The entity which carries out the attack

Exploit: An instance of compromise

Risk: The probability of a threat materializing

Controls: Physical, administrative and technical protections (including both safeguards and countermeasures)

## Lifecycle of risk management

Risk assessment: Categorize, classify and evaluate assets, as well as identify threats and vulnerabilities

Risk analysis: Both qualitative and quantitative

Risk mitigation/response: Includes reducing or avoiding risk, transferring risk, and accepting or rejecting risk

## Security governance and policy

To achieve security governance, security blueprints have to be created to allow organizations to implement practices and procedures to support their security goals and the overall mission of the organizations.

## Security management

Security needs to be directed and supported by top management, referred to as the top-down approach. Most companies follow a bottom-up approach, where the IT department takes security seriously and attempts to develop a security program. This approach usually will not provide those individuals with the necessary funds, support, resources, or attention.
