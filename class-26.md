## Tracking, Detecting, and Thwarting PowerShell-based Malware and Attacks

PowerShell, a legitimate management tool used by system administrators, provides an ideal cover for threat actors as they craft payloads heavily dependent on its deep Windows integration. PowerShell is a scripting language and a command-line shell based on .NET classes that helps system administrators automate tasks in managing operating systems.

Attackers can use fileless malware to get around these safeguards by injecting payloads into running applications or by utilizing scripting. PowerShell is an ideal channel for delivering these attacks because of its wide deployment and access to all parts of a host via the .NET framework.

PowerShell is known to enable significant activity logging capabilities. These functions can also be used to detect, defend, and mitigate against the abuse of this tool. Threat actors may attempt to obfuscate PowerShell commands using the -enc or -EncodedCommand parameter. This command can be decoded from the generated event, and the PowerShell Log Inspection rule will detect and characterize the event accordingly.
