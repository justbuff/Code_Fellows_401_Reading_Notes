# Data Loss Prevention and Data Classification

Data loss prevention (DLP) is a set of tools and processes used to ensure that sensitive data is not lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users. DLP software classifies regulated, confidential and business critical data and identifies violations of orginizational regulatory compliance policies. Once those violations are identified, DLP enforces remediation with alerts, encryption, and other protective actions to prevent end users from accidentally or maliciously sharing data that could put the organization at risk. 

Data loss prevention solves three main objectives:

- Personal Information Protection / Compliance

- IP Protection

- Data Visibility

Nine trends that are driving the wider adoption of DLP:

- The Growth of the CISO Role

- Evolving Compliance Mandates

- There are More Places to Protect Your Data:

- Data Breaches are Frequent and Large

- Your Organization’s Stolen Data is Worth More

- There’s More Data to Steal

- There’s a Security Talent Shortage

DLP best practices:

- Determine your primary data protection objective: determine the most appropriate DLP deployment architecture or combination of architectures. The four main DLP deployment architectures are: Endpoint DLP, Network DLP, Discovery, and Cloud.

- DLP is not a security-only decision

- Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the individuals involved in your organization’s DLP program.

- Start with a clearly defined quick win: define your initial approach and set objectives that are fast and measurable.  

- Work together with business unit heads to define the DLP policies that will govern your organization’s data.

- Document your processes carefully.

- Define success metrics and share reporting with business leaders.

- DLP is a program, not a product; DLP is a constant process of understanding your data and how users, systems, and events interact with that data to better protect it.
