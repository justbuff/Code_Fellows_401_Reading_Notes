# What is a SOC?

A security operations center (SOC) or information security operations center (ISOC) acts as the hub for an organization’s security operations. A SOC is a centralized location where information security professionals use technologies to build and maintain the security architecture that monitors, detects, analyzes and responds to cybersecurity incidents, typically around the clock. A SOC must also analyze threats, investigate the source, report on any vulnerabilities discovered and plan how to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

## Benefits of a SOC

- Respond faster: SOCs provide a centralized, complete, real-time view of how an entire infrastructure is performing from a security standpoint

- Protect consumer and customer trust: SOCs can help build trust in an organization

- Minimize costs: SOCS mitigate the the costs associated with a breach

## Three most common SOC types

Internal SOCs: The internal SOC comprises a physical room where all the action takes place, usually with a full-time staff based on-premises

Virtual SOCs: Virtual SOcs are not on-premises and are made up of part-time or contracted workers who work together in a coordinated manner to resolve issues as needed

Outsourced SOCs: In an outsourced SOC, some or all functions are managed by an external managed security service provider (MSSP) that specializes in security analysis and response

## How a SOC works

Level 1: The first line of incident responders who watch for alerts and determine each alert’s urgency as well as when to move it up to Level 2. Level 1 personnel may also manage security tools and run regular reports.

Level 2: These personnel usually have more expertise so they can quickly get to the root of the problem and assess which part of the infrastructure is under attack. They will follow procedures to remediate the problem and repair any fallout, as well as flag issues for additional investigation.

Level 3: These personnel consist of high-level expert security analysts who are actively searching for vulnerabilities within the network. They will use advanced threat detection tools to diagnose weaknesses and make recommendations for improving the organization’s overall security. Within this group, there might also be specialists, such as forensic investigators, compliance auditors or cybersecurity analysts.

Level 4: This level consists of high-level managers and chief officers with the most years of experience. This group oversees all SOC team activities and is responsible for hiring and training, plus evaluating individual and overall performance. Level 4s step in during crises and serve as the liaison between the SOC team and the rest of the organization. They are also responsible for ensuring compliance with organization, industry and government regulations.
