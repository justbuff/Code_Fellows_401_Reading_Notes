# Malware Detection with YARA Rules

YARA (Yet Another Recursive Acronym or Yet Another Ridiculous Acronym) rules are rules you write and use to try to find malware in your system. YARA is a tool that you can use to track down malware in your computer or network and YARA rules can look for that code along with some of the malwareâ€™s functions and features. You can also write YARA rules for chunks of the malware code itself.

After big cyberattacks or during current cyberattack campaigns, experts may send out YARA rules to help cyber defenders look for the potential malware in their systems.
