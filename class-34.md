# What Is Computer Forensics?

Computer forensic specialists investigate security issues, data breaches, and other cyber crimes. These experts recover documents, photos, emails, and other files from computer systems, hard drives, and other devices. They often work on “cyber crime” and digital cases and examine computer systems to help find digital evidence of illegal activity. 

Computer forensics is also focused on helping organizations deal with network breaches. Forensic specialists will help determine how a breach happened in a computer system. The main focus of these experts is to look at digital breaches and hacks that have already happened, and learn from them for the future. Cybersecurity experts work to keep hackers out, while computer forensics experts focus on how to move forward once a hacker has gotten in.
