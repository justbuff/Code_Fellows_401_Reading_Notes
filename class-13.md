## What is a Reverse Proxy?

A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of web servers and forwards client (e.g. web browser) requests to those web servers. With a reverse proxy, when clients send requests to the origin server of a website, those requests are intercepted at the network edge by the reverse proxy server. The reverse proxy server will then send requests to and receive responses from the origin server.

Benefits of a reverse proxy:

- Load balancing

- Protection from attacks

- Global Server Load Balancing

- Caching

- SSL encryption

## What is a Proxy Server?

A proxy server. or forward proxy, is a server that sits in front of a group of client machines. When those computers make requests to sites and services on the Internet, the proxy server intercepts those requests and then communicates with web servers on behalf of those clients, like a middleman.

Reasons to use a forward proxy:

- To avoid state or institutional browsing restrictions

- To block access to certain content 

- To protect online identity
