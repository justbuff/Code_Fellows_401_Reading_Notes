# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

A VPC is a public cloud offering that lets an enterprise establish its own private cloud-like computing environment on shared public cloud infrastructure. 

VPC features:

- Agility: Scale resources dynamically and in real-time

- Availability: Redundant resources and highly fault-tolerant availability zone architectures

- Security: Full control over how resources and workloads are accessed, and by whom. Security controls include Access Control Lists (ACLs) and security groups.

- Affordability: Savings on hardware costs, labor times, and other resources.

VPC benefits:

- Flexible business growth

- Satisfied customers

- Reduced risk across the entire data lifecycle

- More resources to channel toward business innovation

VPC architecture:

- Compute: Virtual server instances (VSIs, also known as virtual servers) are presented to the user as virtual CPUs (vCPUs)

- Storage: VPC customers are typically allocated a certain block storage quota per account, with the ability to purchase more

- Networking: You can deploy virtual versions of various networking functions into your virtual private cloud account to enable or restrict access to its resources

Three tiers of VPC architecture:

- The web or presentation tier, which takes requests from web browsers and presents information created by, or stored within, the other layers to end users.

- The application tier, which houses the business logic and is where most processing takes place.

- The database tier, comprised of database servers that store the data processed in the application tier.
