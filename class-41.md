# Penetration Testing

A penetration test, also known as a pen test, is a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. In the context of web application security, penetration testing is commonly used to augment a web application firewall (WAF).
 
The pen testing process:

1. Planning and reconnaissance- Defines the scope and goals of a test and gathers intelligence.

2. Scanning- Conducted in two different ways: Static analysis, which inspects an application’s code to estimate the way it behaves while running, and Dynamic analysis, which inspects an application’s code in a running state. 

3. Gaining Access- This stage uses web application attacks, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection and backdoors, to uncover a target’s vulnerabilities.

4. Maintaining access- The goal of this stage is to see if the vulnerability can be used to achieve a persistent presence in the exploited system.

5. Analysis- The results of the penetration test are then compiled into a report.

Pen testing methods:

External testing- Targets the assets of a company that are visible on the internet, e.g., the web application itself, the company website, and email and domain name servers (DNS). 

Internal testing- A tester with access to an application behind its firewall simulates an attack by a malicious insider.

Blind testing- A tester is only given the name of the enterprise that’s being targeted.

Double-blind testing- Security personnel have no prior knowledge of the simulated attack.

Targeted testing- Both the tester and security personnel work together and keep each other appraised of their movements.
