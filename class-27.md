# PowerShell Empire Framework Is No Longer Maintained

The PowerShell Empire post-exploitation framework used by hackers of all hats has been discontinued, mostly due to the security optics and improvements that have been provided by Microsoft in the past few years. Its open-source nature and modular architecture allowed it to grow and fulfill the needs of offensive security teams, who saw in it an opportunity to test defenses by imitating attacks from real threat actors.

One of its major advantages is that it uses encrypted communication with the command and control server and made it difficult to detect its traffic, especially in large networks. While it became a common tool for penetration testers, Empire was also embraced for malicious activities. Researchers saw it used by various threat groups, from nation-state hackers to financially-driven ones. Threat actors also used it with increased frequency in high-profile ransomware incidents.
