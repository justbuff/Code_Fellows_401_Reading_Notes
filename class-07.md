# Protecting Data at Rest with Device Encryption

Data in transit, or data in motion, is data actively moving from one location to another such as across the internet or through a private network. Data is often considered less secure while in motion.

Data at rest is data that is not actively moving from device to device or network to network such as data stored on a hard drive, laptop, flash drive, or archived/stored in some other way. Data protection at rest aims to secure inactive data stored on any device or network. 

Data can be exposed to risks both in transit and at rest and requires protection in both states. Encryption plays a major role in data protection and is a popular tool for securing data both in transit and at rest. 

For protecting data in transit, enterprises often choose to encrypt sensitive data prior to moving and/or use encrypted connections (HTTPS, SSL, TLS, FTPS, etc) to protect the contents of data in transit. For protecting data at rest, enterprises can simply encrypt sensitive files prior to storing them and/or choose to encrypt the storage drive itself.

In addition to encryption, the best practices for robust data protection for data in transit and data at rest include:

- Implement robust network security controls to help protect data in transit.

- Donâ€™t rely on reactive security to protect your valuable company data.

- Choose data protection solutions with policies that enable user prompting, blocking, or automatic encryption for sensitive data in transit.

- Create policies for systematically categorizing and classifying all company data.
