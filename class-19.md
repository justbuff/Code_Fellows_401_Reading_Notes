# Amazon GuardDuty

Amazon GuardDuty (located at https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty) is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail data events for Amazon S3 logs, CloudTrail management event logs, DNS logs, Amazon EBS volume data, Kubernetes audit logs, and Amazon VPC flow logs. 

GuardDuty uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IP addresses and domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and malicious activity within your AWS environment. It also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of compromise, such as unauthorized infrastructure deployments, like instances deployed in a Region that has never been used, or unusual API calls like a password policy change to reduce password strength.
