# What Is Malware Analysis?

Malware analysis is defined as “The process of dissecting malware to understand its core components and source code, investigating its characteristics, functionality, origin, and impact to mitigate the threat and prevent future occurrences.”  

Let’s unpack the definition of malware analysis and its objectives: 

- It breaks down the malware: Understanding the code and how it works is integral to blocking malware entry or, at least, its spread across your ecosystem.

- It investigates its characteristics: Every software will leave a unique digital footprint and knowing the exact characteristics of malware makes it easier to detect it.

- It unravels its functionality: Malware analysis tries to determine the intended functionality of the software by reviewing its code.

- It traces the malware’s origin: Malware analysis tries to see beyond the anonymization of the coder and trace it back to its origin — a person, an IP, a geographic location, or even an organization, among others.

- It tries to predict the impact: Its functionality, nature of target systems, the pace of growth, and preferred distribution channels indicate the worst-case scenario impact of malware. This enables companies to plan and deploy mitigation procedures.

## Malware Analysis Process

Step 1: Capture the malware. 

Step 2: Build a malware lab. 

Step 3: Install your tools.

Step 4: Record the baseline. 

Step 5: Commence your investigation. 

Step 6: Document the results.

## Types of Malware Analysis

1. Static malware analysis: this type of analysis examines static properties like metadata, headers, embedded assets, etc.  

2. Dynamic malware analysis: allows the malware to play itself out in a controlled environment while observing its behavior. 

3. Manual malware analysis: breaks down the code manually, using tools like debuggers, decompilers, and decrypters. 

4. Automated malware analysis: automated workflow where the malware's different behavioral and static properties are tested.

## Key Stages of Malware Analysis

1. Observing malware behavior

2. Disassembling the code 

3. Examining the memory

## Top 6 Malware Analysis Best Practices

1. Expand your malware sample size continuously.

2. Use automation to optimize your efforts.

3. Always use a secure environment to run malware.

4. Only analyze malware whose remote infrastructure is running.

5. Capture and store VM image snapshots.

6. Do your research and select the best-fit malware analysis tools.
